Software developer with a passion for working in Java, C/C++, Python, and always exploring new technologies. I have a strong background in developing software solutions that range from backend systems to user-facing applications. I enjoy solving complex problems, learning about system design, and collaborating with others to build impactful projects. 

In my free time, I like tackling coding challenges, working on side projects, and staying up to date with the latest developments in the tech world. Iâ€™m enthusiastic about continuous learning and improving both my technical and soft skills.

Feel free to connect with me via LinkedIn to discuss software development, tech trends, or any interesting project ideas!
