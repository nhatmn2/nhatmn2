<br>I have 4 years of experience in software development and IT analysis, focusing on quality assurance, system troubleshooting, and MSSQL. In my current role as an IT Programmer Analyst, Iâ€™ve led multiple projects that involved analyzing system bugs, implementing QA software changes, and enhancing database performance. One of my notable achievements was streamlining a key system process, reducing processing time by 30%. I have strong experience with Python, Java, and SQL, and Iâ€™ve worked extensively with Hadoop and Spark in big data projects. Iâ€™m particularly excited about this role because it aligns with my expertise in software development and my passion for optimizing system performance. Outside of work, I enjoy staying updated on the latest tech trends and contributing to open-source projects. Iâ€™m always looking to learn new skills and apply them in practical ways.
